# App created with React and Material UI Library
## The app connects to the Stack Exchange API and displays all of the tags found on stackoverflow.com website. The user can also set the numbers of rows displayed on the page.

### I've created this app in order to get to know Material UI component library for React. Especially I was curious about the DataGrid component which faciliates displaying large amounts of data. While creating the app I've also encountered the Storybook for the first time. I've learned the very basics of it and now I am looking forward to use it in bigger projects.
